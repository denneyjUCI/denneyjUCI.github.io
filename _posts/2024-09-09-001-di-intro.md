# What is it?

___

Dependency Injection (or DI from here on out), to quote [James Shore](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/blog/2006/dependency-injection-demystified), is "a $25 term for a $0.05 concept": passing instance variables.

That's it. No fancy container frameworks needed, just passing a variable to an object.

While James explains it extremely well in the article linked above, I wanted to take a stab at it, for my own learning if nothing else.

## Concrete Example

To clarify, let's take a look at some code. This is intentionally kept simple to keep scope creep to a minimum :).

```swift
class API { 
	func loadData() async -> String {
		return "some data"
	}			   
}

class Example {
	private let api: API
	init() { 
		api = API()
	}

	func doStuff() { 
		print(api.loadData())
	}
}

let example = Example()
example.doStuff() // prints "some data"
```

Let's make one change to the code: making the dependency on the API explicit through the constructor

```swift
class API { 
	func loadData() async -> String {
		return "some data"
	}			   
}

class Example {
	private let api: API
	init(api: API) { 
		self.api = api
	}

	func doStuff() { 
		print(api.loadData())
	}
}

let api = API()
let example = Example(api: api)
example.doStuff() // also prints "some data"
```

**Note:** The behavior of the system is the same, but passing the object allows us to modify that behavior _without_ the base type or clients being aware of the change.

```swift

// Previous classes omitted for brevity

class APITimingWrapper: API {
    private let wrapped: API
    init(wrapped: API) {
        self.wrapped = wrapped
    }

    override func loadData() async throws -> String {
        let now = Date()
        do {
            let result = try await wrapped.loadData()
            print("Succeeded in \(Date().timeIntervalSince(now))s")
            return result
        } catch {
            print("Failed in \(Date().timeIntervalSince(now))s")
            throw error
        }
    }
}

let api = API()
let example = Example(api: api)
example.doStuff()

// prints "some data", and also prints how long the request took
```

Many base classes in swift can be more easily represented by a protocol, leading us to a final solution

```swift
protocol API { 
	func loadData() async throws -> String
}

class ImmediateAPI: API {
	func loadData() async throws -> String {
		return "some data"
	}
}

class APITimingWrapper: API {
    private let wrapped: API
    init(wrapped: API) {
        self.wrapped = wrapped
    }

    override func loadData() async throws -> String {
        let now = Date()
        do {
            let result = try await wrapped.loadData()
            print("Succeeded in \(Date().timeIntervalSince(now))s")
            return result
        } catch {
            print("Failed in \(Date().timeIntervalSince(now))s")
            throw error
        }
    }
}

let api = ImmediateAPI()
let wrapped = APIProfilingWrapper(wrapped: api)
let example = Example(api: wrapped)
example.doStuff()
```
